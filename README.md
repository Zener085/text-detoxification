# text detoxification #
This is my little project about text detoxification. I tried to find some good solutions for this task and
compare them to each other.

## How to use ##
To use the model for detoxification, just use `src/models.predict` function. You may find the example of its work here.
To train your own model you may use `src/models.train` function. You may found how I did it here.
The whole process was made by using initial dataset for this problem. If you want to add new examples, you have to
create then your own training and evaluation processes, or add samples to the dataset.
